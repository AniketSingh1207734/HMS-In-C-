# Project Description
This is a simple Hospital Management System written in C++. The program allows users to manage patient information, doctor details, prescriptions, and user authentication. It provides a command-line interface (CLI) where users can view lists of patients and doctors, and add prescriptions to patients' records. The system loads data from external text files for patients, doctors, and users, making it easy to persist and manage data across sessions.
